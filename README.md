# Project Name: Asian Ethnicity Classifier

This model will (attempt to) classify the input pictures into 4 different Asian ethinicities (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese). *Please note that I accidentally miss-spelt "ethnicity" as "ethinicity" on my directories/files.*

## The Algorithm

I used the pre-trained ImageNet model and by using transfer-learning, I taught the model to classify those 4 classes (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese). Since it was pretty hard to find datasets, I was only able to train for each class with around 80-90 images, so it's accuracy is not the greatest.
