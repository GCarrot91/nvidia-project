Project name: asian_ethinicity classification
Project by: Rento Saijo (w/ Nvidia)

Purpose: I wanted to create a model that can classify different Asian faces of different Asian ethinicities because I often get mis-interpreted as a different ethinicity than what I actually am (Japanese).

Process: Download the dataset from (to be filled). Then, using train.py in jetson-inference/python/traning/classification, train the model using the downloaded datasets. To test it, use ImageNet.py (linked here). You can additionally download the tested images using scp.
